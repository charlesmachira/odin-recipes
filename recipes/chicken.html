    <h2>What is chicken BBQ</h2>
    <p>
        These smoked chicken legs are so versatile and easy! I like to use applewood chips or other fruit woods, but maple is also a great choice. 
        Use your favorite BBQ rub. Letting the legs air-dry in the refrigerator overnight, combined with a higher smoking temperature, 
        helps prevent rubbery skin that is common when smoking chicken. Serve with your favorite BBQ sauce, if desired.
